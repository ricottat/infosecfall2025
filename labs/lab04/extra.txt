Defense strategies against phishing include building secure email gateway, using phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication, training internal users, and keeping software updated.  

Secure email gateway detects malicious content from external traffic by analyzing URLs, attachments and keywords, identifying known threats and using machine learning to identidy suggested threat. 

Phishing-resistant MFA uses cryptographic keys to eliminate authentication on phishing sites, passkeys and devise confirmation to bind authentication to specific device.

User training focuses on educating server users to identify, respond to, and report phishing attacks by giving actual information about phishing techniques and conducting phishing simulations.

Updating software stops hackers from exploiting discovered vulnerabilities of the software.
